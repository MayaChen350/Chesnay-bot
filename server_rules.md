#     RULES
1. Respect everyone in the server **despite their differences**
2. Please keep the channels either in **english, french, or frenglish**
3. This is **not a dating server**. Don't ask me (the answer will always be no im forever linked to <@340534549006254091>) or anyone for a date or **don't try to flirt with anyone** in order to start a relationship. If you seriously try to **flirt with me you will be banned.** You're not going to replace my boyfriend got it?
4. Don't be a serial murderer.
5. If you are accused of something you have the **right of a lawyer and a court** if you **agree to not cause drama** and are **not trying** to prove your **innocence without proof**
6. If you are **not** in **my** or **my bf's friend list**, we **might ban you**. We don't really want random people.
7. **No talk about religions** in any public channel
8. **Nsfw jokes once in a while at good moments** can be **okay**, but **don't abuse it.** Also one thing I want to be clear on: **no discussion about porn, kinks** or **fetishisms** or **anything sexual** or **don't try to start one.** And we don't want to know the porn you watch or what you do with your hands or your partners. Please **keep that kind of personal stuff for yourself** or **consequences will be.**
9. There are **minors** in the server. Act in consequence **in good ways.**
10. I'll ask you to **refrain** from **sending any, slightly or not, NSFW gifs**,  **images**, **video** or **file** in the server. **Consequences might occur.**
11. **Don't talk about** any **members** who are **banned.** If they are banned for most it's most probably because I don't want to hear about them again.
12. No talk about drugs. Whether illegal, prescribed, medecinal, or whatever this is still a triggering subject.
13. No jokes about suicide. It's common sense.


Additional notes you should know:
- Only I have been allowed to call <@340534549006254091> Vince, call him Pat or Patrice
- Eventually, an open-source bot designed by me will be used to manage the server. You can find it at https://github.com/MayaChen350/DreamHouse-bot

Additional rules might be added in the future
